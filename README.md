# Data Science Student with a Passion for Neural Networks 🧠

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a dedicated data science student with a strong enthusiasm for exploring and implementing neural networks. This repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and learning resources in the exciting world of data science and machine learning.

# About me

🎓 I am currently pursuing my Masters in Data Science, where I hone my skills in statistics, programming and machine learning.

🚀 My journey in data science is driven by a passion for extracting insights from data and creating solutions to real problems.

🌟 Particularly, I have a keen interest in the fascinating realm of neural networks, where I am eager to delve into cutting-edge techniques and applications.

# Projects

Here are some highlights of the services you will find in this store:

### Face Mask Detector using TensorFlow - (https://github.com/sohamfcb/face-mask-detector)
A practice project that can figure out whether a person is wearing a mask or not from real time webcam streams. It was trained on a dataset consisting of pictures of people with and without a mask. The VGG-16 model was used as a base model that was trained. CV2 was used to capture real time webcam streams and capture the frames from them which were analysed.A practice project that can figure out whether a person is wearing a mask or not from real time webcam streams.

Skills: TensorFlow · Keras · Artificial Intelligence (AI) · Image Recognition · Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) · Python (Programming Language) · Supervised Learning

### Movie Recommendation Engine - (https://github.com/sohamfcb/movie-recommender)
A practice project that recommends 5 similar movies to a given movie. It calculates the similarity between two movies through its content by their cosine similarity. The text documents are converted to vectors (bag of words representation in this case) using sklearn's CountVectorizer class after which the cosine similarities between the vectors were calculated.A practice project that recommends 5 similar movies to a given movie.
