# 👋 Hey there, I'm Soham Mukherjee!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate **Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast** who loves building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Whether it's **computer vision, NLP, or AI-driven applications**, I dive deep into every project to truly understand its inner workings.

My journey into AI started with a curiosity to make technology more human-like, and over time, I've built multiple projects that bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. I enjoy working on **end-to-end AI solutions**, from **data preprocessing and model building** to **deployment and optimization**. My key focus areas include:

- **Computer Vision:** Building AI models for face recognition, object detection, and image classification.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Creating text-based AI models for sentiment analysis, chatbot systems, and search optimization.
- **MLOps & AI Deployment:** Ensuring AI models are scalable and efficient using **Streamlit, Flask, and Firebase**.

## 🛠️ My Projects

### 🔹 Face Recognition Attendance System
A cutting-edge **AI-based attendance system** that uses facial recognition to automate attendance tracking. It captures images via a webcam, identifies faces using **OpenCV and face_recognition library**, and logs attendance into **Firebase** for cloud storage and retrieval. This system is ideal for institutions and workplaces looking to enhance efficiency and security.

### 🔹 Live AI Google Search
A smarter way to search! This project enhances **Google Search** results using **NLP techniques** to improve relevance and contextual understanding using LangChain tools and Google's Programmable Search API to retrieve real-time information. By integrating AI-powered summarization and query expansion, it refines search outcomes to provide more **accurate and meaningful results**.

### 🔹 Automatic License Plate Detection
An AI-powered **license plate recognition system** that detects and extracts plate numbers from vehicle images. This project employs **YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection** and **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction. It’s deployed using **Streamlit**, making it an accessible and user-friendly tool for traffic surveillance and automated toll collection.

### 🔹 WhatsApp Chat Analyzer
Ever wondered about your WhatsApp chat habits? This tool performs **data analysis on WhatsApp chats**, extracting insights such as message frequency, most active hours, emoji usage, and word trends. Built with **Python and pandas**, it helps users gain a deeper understanding of their **texting behavior and communication patterns**.

### 🔹 Fake News Detector
Misinformation is a major issue today, and this project aims to tackle it. The **Fake News Detector** leverages **deep learning with LSTM networks in TensorFlow** to classify news articles as real or fake. The model is trained on a dataset of real and fake news articles to **accurately detect false information**, helping to curb misinformation.

### 🔹 Decision Tree Hyperparameter Analysis Tool
A **visualization tool** that allows users to experiment with different hyperparameters of a **Decision Tree model** and observe their impact on performance. This interactive project, built using **Streamlit and scikit-learn**, is designed to help users understand the importance of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models.
